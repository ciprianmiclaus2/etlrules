# Installation

## Stable release

To install ETLrules, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
pip install etlrules
```

This is the preferred method to install ETLrules, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for ETLrules can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][].

You can either clone the public repository:

``` console
git clone git://github.com/ciprianmiclaus2/etlrules
```

Or download the [tarball][]:

``` console
curl -OJL https://github.com/ciprianmiclaus2/etlrules/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

``` console
pip install .
```
